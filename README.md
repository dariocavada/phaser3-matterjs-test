# phaser3-matterjs-test
Phaser3 matterjs physics using TexturePacker and Physics Editor tools

## Use TexturePacket to create spritesheet

## Use PhysicsEditor to create shapes

## Use Phaser3 and MatterJS Physics

### Test 01: Physics with texture packer + physics editor (no mouse dragging)

### Test 02: Physics with texture packer + physics editor (problems with mouse dragging using matterjs)

### Test 03: Physics with texture packer (without using a shape mouse dragging using matterjs works)

### Test 04: Physics with texture packer + physics editor (work around using PhaserJS 3 dragging)
